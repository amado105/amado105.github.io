 <p>Founded by the Romans, Sevilla became an important city where 2 of the 5 Good Emporers were born in. After the fall of the Roman Empire, the city was largely abandoned until the Moors crossed over from Northern Africa and conquered much of Spain. Then in the 13th century, the Christians retook Sevilla. It became arguably the most important city in the world in the 16th century when it managed everything going in and out of the New World.</p>
